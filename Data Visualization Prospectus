Using New York City Hate Crime and Census Demographic data from 2010 and 2020, I am planning to create several maps to determine if:
•	There is a relationship between specific demographic factors and hate crime.
•	Determine if hate crime persists over time in a specific geographical location, even with changes in demographic factors over time.
•	Using different geographical boundaries, I will attempt to determine if certain artificial boundaries also influence hate crimes. Specifically, building zoning areas, school districts, and census tracks.
•	Demographic data will also be used to analyze the neighborhood through the lens of Social Disorganization Theory to hypothesize what creates the conflict leading to large numbers of hate crimes [90% group 1 vs. 10% group 2, or is it a more even split]. 
•	To perform this analysis, I will be utilizing the borough of Staten Island in New York City.
